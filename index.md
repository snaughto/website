### About 

'Just One Thing' is a change consultancy that helps leaders ensure they develop and maintain focus on the activities that have the biggest impact on their organisation.
We bring together 25 years of behavioural and organisational change consulting, powerful and dynamic psychometric profiling and the very best change management techniques backed by neuroscience.

We support organisations to take the steps to developing their organisation in the simplest and quickest route and by focusing on habits that bring clarity and focus.  This then translates to a collective shift of culture. 

Whether you are a developing senior team, emerging leaders or individuals we equip people to:

* Focus on the right things and do them well
* Measure the impact and reflect for future growth

### Our Approach

Shifting our behaviour can be difficult, is often not measured and is therefore not prioritised – until people start to break, and then business suffers. 

Collective behavioural change can be so much easier, and it can be measured, when we understand how individuals work (and play). 

We focus on the key things that can be:

- Seen - _observable_ 
- Felt - _measurable_ 
- Heard - _translatable_ 


### What we do 

'Just One Thing' consulting offers a blend of development sessions designed to focus and get clarity on the activities that will have the **biggest** impact at any given time. We believe that these are: 

- The art of showing great leadership behaviours 
- Coaching for performance and overcoming difficult conversations 
- Building great team effectiveness 
- Recognising and demonstrating emotional intelligence 
- Developing personal resilience and building inner stability 


### Our solutions 

#### Senior Team Development 

These workshops focus on developing the three key elements of high performing teams and great outcomes for an organisation: 
- Building Trust 
-  Welcoming conflict 
- Sharing accountability 

Our workshops are designed to build connectivity and encourage natural and open human interactions. We have worked with national and international brands with consistent high results and some brilliant 'a ha' moments. 


#### Leadership Development 

'Just one Thing' is true to its philosophy when it comes to developing leaders and managers. Whether it's a programme to develop a coaching culture, developing current or aspiring management capability, or helping staff with the basics of management, we have a modular approach that will focus on the **one change** that will have the biggest impact on persoonal performance and in turn, on the organisation. 

Each programme is designed to your need and can be as short as two or three focused sessions that move culture or behaviour from one desired state to another, or a longer and more paced programme that covers key abilities of any good leader. These might include: 

- Understanding the shift from Management to Leadership 
- Coaching for Performance 
- Having difficult conversations 
- Influencing Culture 
- Developing introvert or extravert leadership styles 



#### Emotional Intelligence 

We are a 'Licensed Practitioner' of 'Insights Discovery' delivering powerful interactive workshops based on the power of personality and the psychological works of Carl Jung. 

The workshops first begin with a personal profile to build greater self-awareness and next, we take teams to the next level based on their need. All teams will undertake the Insights Discovery day which is extremely powerful in itself. Others want to continue their exploration of Jungian Psychology and the power of personality by doing a 'Team Effectiveness' or 'Leadership Effectiveness' workshop

We also work with organisations who have already undertaken Insights but wish to refresh their awareness or bring on new team members.

### Communications and Influencing

We build on emotional intelligence to work on the art of mastering our language in order to effectively influence others and develop individual performance.  Building on the work of Noam Chomsky (Linguist) and Neuro Linguistic Programming, we deliver session designed to develop the ability to carefully ‘listen and hear’ the language choices of those around us and in turn, tailor our responses in order to:

* Build greater relationships
* Develop our ability to influence and have personal presence
* Improve performance


### Personal Resilience and Well-Being

We provide critical key support and development in the areas of Resilience and Well-Being either as part of a modular programme or as a self-contained development piece.

Bringing together neuroscientific techniques, an understanding of how the brain works and solution focused psychotherapy, organisations get a unique and life time skill set in resetting and reframing their stress/stability balance.  This is underpinned  with powerful self-awareness practice and the development of techniques for self-management that can be used at work or at home.  Sessions cover the key areas of:

* Chronic stress vs inner stability
* How your brain works under stress (and how to take control of it)
* 	4 pillars of balance
* 	Practice and measurement
