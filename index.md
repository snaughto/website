<h1 align="center">'Just One Thing' – Change Consulting</h1>
<h2 align="center">Leadership, Performance, Resilience</h1>

### About 

We're in the business of working with humans. We do this by helping them to direct their energy and resources into the essential things that accelerate or hinder our ability to respond to fast paces of change, enjoyment of work, and ultimately the success of your organisation. 

Shifting our behaviour can be difficult, is often not measured and is therefore not prioritised – until people start to break, and then business suffers. 

Collective behavioural change can be so much easier, and it can be measured, when we understand how individuals work (and play). 

We bring together twenty five years of organisational development experience, neuroscience, cognitive behaviour and personal resilience development that results in change that is: 

- Seen - _observable_ 
- Felt - _measurable_ 
- Heard - _translatable_ 


### What we do 

'Just One Thing' consulting offers a blend of development sessions designed to focus and get clarity on the activities that will have the **biggest** impact at any given time. We believe that these are: 

- The art of showing great leadership behaviours 
- Coaching for performance and overcoming difficult conversations 
- Building great team effectiveness 
- Recognising and demonstrating emotional intelligence 
- Developing personal resilience and building inner stability 


### Our solutions 

#### Senior Team Development 

These workshops focus on developing the three key elements of high performing teams and great outcomes for an organisation: 
- Building Trust 
-  Welcoming conflict 
- Sharing accountability 

Our workshops are designed to build connectivity and encourage natural and open human interactions. We have worked with national and international brands with consistent high results and some brilliant 'a ha' moments. 


#### Leadership Development 

'Just one Thing' is true to its philosophy when it comes to developing leaders and managers. Whether it's a programme to develop a coaching culture, developing current or aspiring management capability or helping staff with the basics of management, we have a modular approach that will focus on the one change that will have the biggest impact on personal performance and impact on the organisation. 

Each programme is designed to your need and can be as short as two or three focused sessions that move culture or behaviour from one desired state to another, or a longer and more paced programme that covers key abilities of any good leader. These might include: 

- Understanding the shift from Management to Leadership 
- Coaching for Performance 
- Having difficult conversations 
- Influencing Culture 
- Developing introvert or extravert leadership styles 


#### Emotional Intelligence 

We are a 'Licensed Practitioner' of 'Insights Discovery' delivering powerful interactive workshops based on the power of personality and the psychological works of Carl Jung. 

The workshops first begin with a personal profile to build greater self-awareness and next we take teams to the next level based on their need. All teams will undertake the Insights Discovery day which is extremely powerful in itself. Others want to continue their exploration of Jungian Psychology and the power of personality by doing a 'Team Effectiveness' or 'Leadership Effectiveness' workshop

We also work with organisations who have already undertaken Insights but wish to refresh their awareness or bring on new team members.

### Personal Resilience and Well Being

…to do 

### Contact
email advice….info@justonething for example? 

Also – a nice feature on some websites is a little 'Let's chat' tab in bottom right that you click on and that saves you having to copy and paste an email address and looks a bit slicker if that's possible 

The website Dream and Leap link I sent has one and it looks quite good.

This is a messy link, it's a subsidiary of my main page but has articles about well being…don't know if this can be tidied up? 

### Articles/Blog 

The articles below are on my LinkedIn account but will take advice on if they should be links to a blog format so I would copy and paste the text to keep it internal to the website?
